# Here is where you should add pokémons using their names (always in lower case) and moves (titled names)
# You can add moves to your pokémons and make them fight against each other with the battle_simulator function
# Add pokémons using this model:
# name = pokémons["pokémon"]
#Add moves using this model:
# move = moves["Move"]
# Battle simulator takes two arguments, the first should always be the pokémon that you want to control
